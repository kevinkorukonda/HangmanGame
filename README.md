# HangmanGame

Hangman is a popular word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player attempts to guess it by suggesting letters. The game typically involves a hidden word represented by a series of dashes, with each dash representing a letter in the word. The player making the guesses tries to uncover the word by suggesting letters one at a time. If the suggested letter is present in the word, it is revealed in its correct position(s). However, if the suggested letter is not in the word, a part of a stick figure, often a gallows, is drawn as a visual representation of a hanging man. The player continues guessing letters until either the entire word is revealed (winning the game) or the full stick figure is drawn (losing the game). Hangman is an entertaining and challenging game that tests the player's vocabulary, deduction skills, and ability to strategize their letter guesses.
